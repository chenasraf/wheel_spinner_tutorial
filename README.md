# wheel_spinner_tutorial

This is an example app containing the code from [my tutorial](https://casraf.blog/2019/03/flutter-tutorial-creating-a-wheel-spinner-widget) on creating a Wheel Spinner.
There is also a more customizable, actual package at [pub.dartlange.org](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/wheel_spinner) (or check out the source at [GitHub](https://github.com/chenasraf/wheel_spinner)).
